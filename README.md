# -Simon-Says---Memory-Game
A simple and fun color-based memory game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Inspired by the classic "Simon Says" game, this project challenges users to repeat a growing sequence of flashing colors. Great for practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic!
